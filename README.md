# MailElephant

## About

This project tries to deliver a system for sending newsletters, like PHPList,
but with the functionality and quality of systems like MailChimp.

The system should be deployable on your own machine, but also be able to run 
as an hosted service, e.g. a company wanting to sell newsletter sending
services.

### The name

PHP's icon is sometimes found with an elephant images.

## Background

My needs for starting this project were quite simple: 
* Manage a list of subscribtions via an API (e.g. SOAP)
* Parse an email (from a source like an IMAP mailbox)
* Send the email to the list of subscribers

## Roadmap

Functionality mentioned above will be released as version 0.1 of this product.
